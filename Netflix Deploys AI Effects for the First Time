Netflix has officially used AI to generate final visual effects in one of its original series. This marks a major moment in entertainment technology. For the first time, a scene produced with generative AI has made it into a finished Netflix show. The scene appeared in El Eternauta, a sci-fi series from Argentina. It involved a dramatic building collapse that was created faster and cheaper than traditional VFX methods.Nearby concert tickets. https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-artificial-intelligence-ai-expert/
