The European Union has officially finalized its new AI Code of Practice. This marks a major step in helping companies prepare for the enforcement of the EU AI Act, which begins on August 2, 2025. The Code is voluntary but highly encouraged. It gives companies a clear path to comply with new AI rules without waiting for full legal enforcement. https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-artificial-intelligence-ai-expert/
