Runway has just introduced Aleph, a powerful new AI tool that allows users to edit real video footage using simple text prompts. Unlike traditional video editing software, Aleph doesnâ€™t require advanced technical skills. You describe what you want, and the AI does it for you. This includes changing camera angles, removing objects, relighting scenes, and even adding new elements. https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-bitcoin-expert-cbie/
