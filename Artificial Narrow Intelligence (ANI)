Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), commonly referred to as “Weak AI,” is designed to perform well in particular tasks. Its focus is on handling specific jobs efficiently. Unlike more complex AI types, such as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), ANI remains confined to predefined tasks within a limited scope. Even though it has boundaries, ANI plays a significant role in various technologies we use regularly.  https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/ai/artificial-narrow-intelligence-ani/
