Context engineering is the practice of shaping the information given to large language models so they deliver answers that are accurate, safe, and efficient. It is not about training the model itself but about managing what goes in at query time and how it is arranged. In simple words, it is the art of giving the model the right context at the right moment. This has become essential for building reliable AI systems in business, research, and everyday tools. For anyone serious about working in this field, an AI Certification is a practical way to gain structured knowledge and hands-on skill. https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-bitcoin-expert-cbie/
