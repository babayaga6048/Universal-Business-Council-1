Alpha School has launched a new AI-driven education model that compresses traditional K-12 academics into just two hours a day. This approach uses personalized AI tutors for core subjects and leaves the rest of the day for hands-on workshops, mentorship, and life skills. Itâ€™s now expanding rapidly across the US, with plans to open multiple campuses by the end of 2025. https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-bitcoin-expert-cbie/
