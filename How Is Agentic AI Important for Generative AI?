The field of artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing at a rapid pace, with generative AI leading the way in transforming industries, automating content creation, and personalizing user experiences. However, as generative AI systems grow in complexity, a new paradigm, Agentic AI, is emerging to enhance their capabilities. Agentic AI introduces autonomous decision-making and self-improving models, making generative AI more efficient, adaptable, and secure. https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/ai/how-is-agentic-ai-important-for-generative-ai/
