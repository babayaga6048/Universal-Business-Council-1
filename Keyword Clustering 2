Keyword clustering involves sorting similar keywords into specific groups, all linked by meaning or intent. This method helps boost a websiteâ€™s chances of appearing prominently on search result pages. It also makes it easier to target several related terms using fewer pages, saving time during optimization efforts. Organizing keywords based on their common themes not only improves ranking potential but also enhances how users interact with your site. https://www.universalbusinesscouncil.org/seo/keyword-clustering/
