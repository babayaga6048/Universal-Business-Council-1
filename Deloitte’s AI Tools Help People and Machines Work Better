Deloitte has developed and deployed a set of AI tools that help employees do their work faster and more efficiently. These tools are not built to replace people. Instead, they support daily work by automating repetitive tasks, improving planning, and helping teams make better decisions. From Australia to the US, Deloitte is showing how people and machines can collaborate successfully across industries and job roles. https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-artificial-intelligence-ai-expert/
