Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have become a key part of modern artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). These networks are modeled after how the human brain works, and they use algorithms to detect patterns and make decisions from data.  https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/ai/artificial-neural-networks/
