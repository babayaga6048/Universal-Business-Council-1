Lately, there has been a noticeable rise in interest around Small Language Models (SLMs) in the AI world. These models offer an alternative to the larger language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or PaLM. While these big models handle a variety of tasks, they also bring challenges. These include high computational demands and concerns over data privacy. SLMs, in contrast, are smaller, more efficient, and often crafted for specific tasks with improved effectiveness. https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/ai/small-language-models/
