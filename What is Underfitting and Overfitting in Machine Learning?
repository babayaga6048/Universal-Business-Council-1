When dealing with machine learning models, two frequent problems can influence how the model works: overfitting and underfitting. These issues relate to how well the model can handle new data. Simply put, overfitting happens when the model learns too much from the training set, while underfitting means it learns too little. https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/ai/underfitting-and-overfitting-in-machine-learning/
