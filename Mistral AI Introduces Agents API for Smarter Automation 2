Mistral AI has launched a new Agents API that helps developers build AI systems that don’t just chat—but actually do things. These agents can run code, search the web, generate images, and remember past conversations. They can even work together to solve multi-step tasks. https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/artificial-intelligence/certified-python-developer/
