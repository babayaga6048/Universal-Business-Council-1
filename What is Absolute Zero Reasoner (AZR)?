Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR) is an advanced AI training framework that allows models to generate, verify, and solve their own reasoning tasks—without relying on human-labeled data. In other words, AZR lets AI systems design their own challenges, solve them, and learn from the process. This makes AZR a highly autonomous, scalable, and efficient way to build smarter AI models—especially in coding and math tasks. https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/artificial-intelligence/certified-artificial-intelligence-expert/
