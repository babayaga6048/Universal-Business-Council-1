Artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are transforming the manufacturing industry, especially in the way equipment is maintained. Predictive maintenance allows businesses to anticipate machine issues before they occur, enabling timely fixes that keep operations running smoothly while saving costs. Through the integration of AI and IoT, manufacturers can monitor equipment in real time, analyze data trends, and address emerging issues before they escalate. https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/ai/impact-of-ai-and-iot-in-predictive-maintenance/
