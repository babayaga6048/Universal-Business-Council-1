ChatGPT Go has been launched in India at just ₹399 per month, making it the most affordable paid plan from OpenAI so far. The plan is built to give students, freelancers, and small businesses access to more powerful AI without stretching their budgets. It offers 10 times more usage than the free version, longer memory, and local UPI payments. In short, ChatGPT Go is OpenAI’s step to make AI available for everyone in India. For those who want to go beyond daily use and build deeper expertise, an AI Certification is a great place to start. https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-bitcoin-expert-cbie/
