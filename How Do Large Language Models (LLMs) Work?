Large Language Models (LLMs) are now an important part of artificial intelligence (AI). Youâ€™ve probably interacted with them through chatbots, digital assistants, or even tools that help with writing. LLMs handle and create text that feels close to human language, making AI interactions more natural and easier to use. These models can handle tasks like translating languages, providing answers, or even writing complex pieces of text.  https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/ai/how-do-large-language-models-work/
