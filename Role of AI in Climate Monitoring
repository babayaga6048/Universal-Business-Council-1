Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking on an ever-growing role in tracking and understanding climate-related issues. It brings fresh methods to assess and reduce the effects of climate changes. By working through large volumes of data and spotting hidden trends, AI improves the way we predict weather, monitor environmental shifts, and craft strategies to handle climate challenges. https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/ai/role-of-ai-in-climate-monitoring/
