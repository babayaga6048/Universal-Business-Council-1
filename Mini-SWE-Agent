Mini-SWE-Agent is a lightweight AI coding assistant built using just 100 lines of Python. Despite its minimal design, it achieves strong results in software engineering tasks. It was developed by researchers from Princeton and Stanford as a stripped-down alternative to larger coding agents. The surprising part? It solves about 65% of GitHub issues from the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, putting it close to more complex tools. https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-bitcoin-expert-cbie/
