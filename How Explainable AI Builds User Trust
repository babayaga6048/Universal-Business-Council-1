As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly influences decisions across various industries, gaining user trust becomes a foundation for its success. Making AI understandable to people is where Explainable AI (XAI) comes in. It works by making systems more open, easy to interpret, and responsible for their actions. By showing how decisions are made, XAI helps users feel confident and encourages fairness, adherence to regulations, and ease of use.  https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/ai/how-explainable-ai-builds-user-trust/
