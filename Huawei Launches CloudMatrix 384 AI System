Huawei has unveiled the CloudMatrix 384, its most advanced AI computing system to date. It combines 384 Ascend 910C chips into a single cluster that rivals, and in some ways exceeds, Nvidia’s latest AI platform. The launch took place at the 2025 World AI Conference in Shanghai and positions Huawei as a key player in large-scale AI infrastructure—especially as the US tightens restrictions on Nvidia’s exports to China. https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-bitcoin-expert-cbie/
