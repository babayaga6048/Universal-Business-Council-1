NASA has tested a new AI system that allows satellites to make decisions on their ownâ€”without waiting for commands from Earth. The system, called Dynamic Targeting, was successfully demonstrated on a CubeSat in orbit. It allows the satellite to decide whether to take a picture based on weather conditions ahead. This is the first time NASA has shown a spacecraft using artificial intelligence to make real-time decisions in space. https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-bitcoin-expert-cbie/
