OpenAI, a major player in artificial intelligence, has announced a big change in how it shares its models. The company is working on releasing an open-weight AI model. That means developers will soon get access to the modelâ€™s trained values. These values help the system understand inputs and give out answers.  https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/ai/open-weight-ai-model/
