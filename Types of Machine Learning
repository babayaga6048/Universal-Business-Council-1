Machine learning (ML) is a field within artificial intelligence (AI). It focuses on training machines to enhance their abilities by processing the data they are provided. This allows them to predict or make decisions with minimal human help. Over time, ML has evolved and is now widely applied in sectors like healthcare, finance, and technology.  https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/ai/types-of-machine-learning/
