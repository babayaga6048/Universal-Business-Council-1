Artificial intelligence models like ChatGPT and Gemini create answers that often feel natural and humanlike. But these responses are not random. They are shaped by several technical and design components working together. From prompts to training data, every element affects how the output looks, sounds, and feels. If you want to understand why AI gives the answers it does, it helps to break down these components step by step. For those planning to master this field, the best place to begin is with an AI certification that teaches both the science and the practice. https://www.blockchain-council.org/blockchain/
