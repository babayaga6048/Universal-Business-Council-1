Anthropic now lets users build and share live AI-powered apps directly inside Claude. No coding background is required. You simply describe the app you want in plain English, and Claude handles the rest â€“ writing the code, showing a live preview, and generating a shareable link. This feature is available to all Claude users, including Free, Pro, and Max tiers. https://www.blockchain-council.org/certifications/certified-artificial-intelligence-ai-expert/
