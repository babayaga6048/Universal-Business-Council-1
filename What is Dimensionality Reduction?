If you’re wondering what Dimensionality Reduction is, the answer is simple: it’s a process used in data analysis and machine learning to reduce the number of features in a dataset while keeping the most important information. By transforming high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional format, it helps make models easier to train, visualize, and interpret. In this article, I’ll explain what dimensionality reduction is, why it matters, how it works, and how you can apply it in your own projects. https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/artificial-intelligence/certified-artificial-intelligence-expert/
