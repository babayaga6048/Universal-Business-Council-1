Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a huge change compared to the current AI technologies weâ€™re familiar with today. Unlike narrow AI, which focuses on particular jobs like image recognition or generating text, AGI aims to manage a variety of tasks, much like humans. It has the ability to learn, understand, and adapt to various areas without needing separate programming for each task. https://www.globaltechcouncil.org/ai/use-cases-of-general-ai/
